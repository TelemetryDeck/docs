## Heads up!

We're still working a lot on the API, so we'll be adding new features and improvements as we go. This also means that sometimes things might break, although we're doing our best to prevent that. Let us know if you see any issues.

Officially, we only allow API access for users in our Tier 2 Pricing tier and above. However, this is currently not enforced by the API, and there will be a grace period before it is. Feel free to try things out and let us know what you think! <3

## Authorization

You need a Bearer Token to authenticate against the TelemetryDeck API. Our article [Getting an API Token](/docs/api/api-token/) explains how to get a Bearer Token.

## TelemetryDeck Query Language

TelemetryDeck Query Language (TQL) is a JSON-based language for querying time-series data stored in TelemetryDeck. To get the data for an insight, we have to get its query first. You can then [execute the query](/docs/api/api-run-query/) and get the results.

## Time intervals and relative time intervals

A TelemetryDeck query only always needs a specified time interval. You can either specify a specific time interval (such as "June 1st, 2022 to June 31st, 2022"), or you can use a relative time interval (such as "the last 30 days").

In this example, we're going to use relative time intervals. Here's an example relative interval for the last 30 days.

```json
{
  "beginningDate": {
    "component": "day",
    "offset": -30,
    "position": "beginning"
  },
  "endDate": {
    "component": "day",
    "offset": 0,
    "position": "end"
  }
}
```

The `beginningDate` is the start of the interval, and the `endDate` is the end of the interval. The `component` is the time unit, and the `offset` is the number of units. The `position` is either "beginning" or "end", and determines whether the point in time is at the `beginning` or the `end` of the component – usually, you'll want `beginning` for the `beginningDate` and `end` for the `endDate`.

## Getting the query for an insight

To generate the query that is behind an insight, you need its ID. You can get the ID by looking at the URL of the insight in the Dashboard.

Then use that ID to generate an HTTP POST to the API. The POST body needs to be a JSON object with the `relativeInterval` field, which should contain a relative time interval as described in the previous section.

Here's an example query:

```text
POST /api/v3/insights/<insight-id>/query/ HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer 🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.telemetrydeck.com

{
  "relativeInterval": {
    "beginningDate": {
      "component": "day",
      "offset": -30,
      "position": "beginning"
    },
    "endDate": {
      "component": "day",
      "offset": 0,
      "position": "end"
    }
  }
}
```

This will generate and return a complete query for the insight you specified:

```json
{
  "aggregations": [
    {
      "fieldName": "count",
      "name": "count",
      "type": "longSum"
    }
  ],
  "dataSource": "telemetry-signals",
  "dimension": {
    "dimension": "modelName",
    "outputName": "modelName",
    "type": "default"
  },
  "filter": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "dimension": "appID",
        "type": "selector",
        "value": "B97579B6-FFB8-4AC5-AAA7-DA5796CC5DCE"
      },
      {
        "dimension": "isTestMode",
        "type": "selector",
        "value": "false"
      }
    ],
    "type": "and"
  },
  "granularity": "all",
  "metric": {
    "metric": "count",
    "type": "numeric"
  },
  "queryType": "topN",
  "relativeIntervals": [
    {
      "beginningDate": {
        "component": "day",
        "offset": -30,
        "position": "beginning"
      },
      "endDate": {
        "component": "day",
        "offset": 0,
        "position": "end"
      }
    }
  ],
  "threshold": 200
}
```

You can [execute the query](api-run-query.html) to get its results.
