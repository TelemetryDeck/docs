## What is User Retention?

User retention measures how effectively your app keeps users coming back after their initial experience. These metrics help you understand user loyalty, identify engagement patterns, and spot opportunities to strengthen long-term relationships with your user base.

With TelemetryDeck's Retention dashboard, these insights focus on users who can be considered "returning users" (those with more than 5 sessions) and are automatically collected with no additional code required beyond updating to SwiftSDK 2.8.0 / KotlinSDK 6.0.0 or later.

Returning users are those who have used your app for more than 5 sessions.

## Returning user growth trends

**Questions you can answer:**
- How many of my users are becoming regular, returning users?
- Are my retention rates improving over time?
- What are the immediate retention patterns in the last 24 hours?
- How do retention trends compare across different time periods?

![Hourly, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Returning Users](/docs/images/retention-returning-users.png)

**How to interpret the charts:**
- **Hourly (last 24h)**: Shows recent returning user activity – useful for immediate validation of retention initiatives
- **Daily patterns**: Consistent levels indicate stable user engagement; growth suggests improving retention strategies
- **Weekly/Monthly trends**: Reveal long-term retention health and seasonal engagement patterns
- **Declining trends**: May indicate user experience issues, feature problems, or competitive pressures

**Action example:** If you see returning users drop significantly after an app update, this suggests the changes may have disrupted established user workflows. The hourly chart helps you detect these issues within hours rather than waiting for weekly reports. Conversely, steady growth in weekly returning users indicates your retention strategies are successfully building user loyalty.

## Retention time patterns

**Questions you can answer:**
- When during the day do returning users typically engage with my app?
- Which days of the week show the strongest user loyalty?
- Do returning users prefer weekdays or weekends for app usage?
- Are retention patterns changing over recent weeks?

![Retention Time Patterns](/docs/images/retention-by-time.png)

**How to interpret the charts:**
- **Hour of day patterns**: Show when returning users are most active (user-local timezone)
- **Day of week distribution**: Reveals which days drive the strongest retention engagement
- **Day patterns (past 4 weeks)**: Identify specific days with exceptional returning user activity
- **Weekend vs. weekday balance**: Indicates whether your app fits into work routines or leisure time

**Action example:** The Hour of Day chart shows returning users are most active during morning commute hours (7-9am) and evening wind-down time (6-8pm), suggesting your app fits into daily routines. The Day of Week chart reveals Tuesday and Wednesday show the strongest retention, while weekends drop off. The Weekend vs Weekday chart shows 75% of returning user activity happens on weekdays, indicating your app serves professional or productivity needs. Schedule feature updates and important communications for Tuesday-Wednesday when user engagement is strongest.

## Retention by device & platform

**Questions you can answer:**
- Which devices retain users most effectively?
- Are there platform-specific retention challenges?
- Should I prioritize retention improvements for specific hardware?

![Returning Users by Device Type](/docs/images/retention-device-distribution.png)

**How to interpret the charts:**
- **Top-retention devices**: These provide the best long-term user experience
- **Poor retention devices**: May have performance issues, UI problems, or technical barriers
- **Platform differences**: iOS vs. macOS vs. other platforms may show different retention strengths

**Action example:** The chart shows iPhone users have strong retention across multiple models, with iPhone 14 and 15 users showing particularly high returning rates (each around 15%). However, certain older devices like iPhone 11 show lower retention (8%), suggesting performance optimization could help. With macOS representing 25% of returning users, ensure your cross-platform experience maintains consistent quality that encourages regular use across both mobile and desktop environments.

## Retention by geography & language

**Questions you can answer:**
- Which regions show the strongest user loyalty?
- What languages correlate with higher long-term engagement?
- Are there cultural or regional patterns in user retention?

![Returning Users by Country and Language](/docs/images/retention-geographic-distribution.png)

**How to interpret the charts:**
- **High-retention regions**: Countries where users consistently return to your app
- **Growing markets**: Regions showing improving retention that warrant additional investment
- **Language loyalty patterns**: Languages that correlate with strong long-term engagement

**Action example:** Looking at the Returning Users by Country chart, you can see that Germany (35%) and the United States (30%) show the strongest retention rates, followed by the United Kingdom (15%). This is different from your acquisition patterns, suggesting German users find particularly strong long-term value in your app. The language distribution shows German (40%) users have exceptional retention rates compared to English (35%), indicating your German localization is especially effective. Consider studying what works well for German users and applying those insights to improve retention in other markets.

## Retention matrix

**Questions you can answer:**
- How does user retention change over time after their first session?
- What percentage of users return after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month?
- When do most users drop off, and when do they become truly loyal?

![Retention Matrix](/docs/images/retention-matrix.png)

**How to interpret the matrix:**
- **Day 1 retention**: Critical early indicator of initial user experience quality
- **Week 1 retention**: Shows whether users find ongoing value after initial exploration
- **Month 1+ retention**: Identifies truly loyal users who have integrated your app into their routine
- **Drop-off patterns**: Reveals critical periods where users decide to stop using your app

**Action example:** The retention matrix shows 60% of users return after Day 1, 35% after Week 1, and 20% maintain active usage after Month 1. The steepest drop-off occurs between Day 3-7, suggesting this is your critical retention window. Focus retention efforts on the first week experience – perhaps with progressive onboarding, helpful tips, or features that become more valuable with repeated use. Users who survive the first month become very loyal (85% still active after 6 months).

## Making data-driven retention decisions

As you analyze your retention metrics, consider these key questions:

1. **Engagement optimization**
   - What daily routines or workflows does your app support, and how can you strengthen those patterns?
   - Which time periods show the strongest retention, and how can you encourage usage during those windows?
   - Are there device or platform experiences that need improvement to match your best-performing retention rates?

2. **User lifecycle management**
   - What does your retention matrix reveal about critical drop-off periods that need attention?
   - How can you extend the honeymoon period where users are most likely to become loyal?
   - What features or experiences correlate with users transitioning from new to returning status?

3. **Market opportunities**
   - Which geographic or language segments show exceptional retention that you could focus acquisition on?
   - Are there retention patterns that suggest your app serves specific use cases particularly well?
   - How can you replicate your highest-retention markets' success in other regions?

Remember that retention is where sustainable app growth happens. Users who return regularly generate the most value, provide the best feedback, and become your strongest advocates for organic growth.

## What's Next?

Start by analyzing your retention matrix to understand your critical drop-off periods, then examine your time patterns to identify when returning users are most engaged. Focus on strengthening the experiences during both your vulnerable periods (early days) and your peak engagement windows.
