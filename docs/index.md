    This is a test for a new documentation system. Trust nothing and no one. The original TelemetryDeck 
    documentation still lives at https://telemetrydeck.com/docs/ for now.

## Welcome to TelemetryDeck

TelemetryDeck helps you understand how users interact with your application through privacy-focused analytics. With just an SDK integration, you'll get valuable insights automatically – no complex configuration required.

### Getting Started in 2 simple steps


- **Choose and install** the SDK for your platform from the guides below
- **Deploy your app** to start collecting data

Once your updated app is in users' hands, TelemetryDeck will begin collecting data. It may take some time before you see meaningful insights, depending on your app's usage.

### What's next after setup?

After setting up the SDK and deploying your app, your most important next step is to learn how to use the dashboard to analyze your data:

- [Analytics Walkthrough](/basics) - Learn how to navigate TelemetryDeck, interpret insights, and use analytics to make data-driven decisions that improve your app and grow your user base.


### Documentation Feedback

If you find an error or feel like the documentation could be improved somewhat, we'd love 
to hear from you! Either directly submit a change request with the buttons on each page, 
or open an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/docs">Docs GitHub Repository</a>.

The [documentation guide](/articles/documentation) explains all markdown and 
additional features you can use while writing documentation for TelemetryDeck.

!!! warning "Needs configuration"
    Note that MathJax is included via a `script` tag on this page and is not
    configured in the generated default configuration to avoid including it
    in a pages that do not need it. See the documentation for details on how
    to configure it on all your pages if they are more Maths-heavy than these
    simple starter pages.

<script id="MathJax-script" src="https://unpkg.com/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
      displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
      processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
    }
  };

  document$.subscribe(() => {
