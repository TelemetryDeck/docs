<h2>Welcome to TelemetryDeck</h2>

<p>TelemetryDeck helps you understand how users interact with your application through privacy-focused analytics. With just an SDK integration, you'll get valuable insights automatically – no complex configuration required.</p>

<h3>Getting Started in 2 simple steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose and install the SDK</strong> for your platform from the guides below</li>
  <li><strong>Deploy your app</strong> to start collecting data</li>
</ol>

<p>Once your updated app is in users' hands, TelemetryDeck will begin collecting data. It may take some time before you see meaningful insights, depending on your app's usage.</p>

<h3>What's next after setup?</h3>

<p>After setting up the SDK and deploying your app, your most important next step is to learn how to use the dashboard to analyze your data:</p>
