## What Are Pirate Metrics?

Pirate Metrics (AARRR) is a framework created by venture capitalist Dave McClure that breaks down the user journey into five key stages: **A**cquisition, **A**ctivation, **R**etention, **R**eferral, and **R**evenue. The name "Pirate Metrics" comes from the sound pirates make: "AARRR!"

This framework helps you focus on the metrics that truly matter for app growth:

### **Acquisition**: How do users find your app?
- Where are new users coming from?
- When do users typically discover your app?
- What devices are they using?
- Which regions show the strongest growth?

### **Activation**: Do users have a great first experience?
- Are users actively engaging with your app?
- How long are their sessions?
- Which features do they discover first?
- When do they typically use your app?

### **Retention**: Do users keep coming back?
- How often do users return to your app?
- Who are your power users?
- What usage patterns develop over time?
- Which features drive ongoing engagement?

### **Referral**: Do users tell others about your app?
- Which channels drive the most referrals?
- How effective are your sharing mechanisms?
- Do referred users convert better than non-referred ones?

### **Revenue**: Does your app generate sustainable revenue?
- How effectively does your app convert users to customers?
- What's your average revenue per user?
- Which purchase options are most popular?
- When do users typically make purchases?

## TelemetryDeck's Pirate Metrics Implementation

TelemetryDeck now automatically captures data for the AARRR framework, with no additional code required beyond updating to our latest SDK (SwiftSDK 2.8.0+, KotlinSDK 6.0.0+, FlutterSDK 2.3.0+).

In your TelemetryDeck dashboard, you'll find these metrics organized within the **Customers** tab in the sidebar. Each component of the AARRR framework has its own section, providing you with a complete view of your app's performance throughout the user journey.
