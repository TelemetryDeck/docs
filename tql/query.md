Most queries for TelemetryDeck can be constructed using the regular Insight Editor. However, if you need to construct a query that's not supported by the Insight Editor, or your query is more complicated and deeper than what the Insight Editor supports, you can use the TelemetryDeck Query Language (TQL) to construct your query.

You can use the TQL Query Builder to construct your query, or you can write it by hand. The minimum required properties are `granularity`, `dataSource` and `queryType`. The following sections describe the properties of the query object.

{% noteinfo "This looks curiously familiar" %}

If you've ever worked with [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org), you'll notice a lot of similarities between TQL and Druid's native query language. This is because TQL is a superset of Druid's native query language, and TQL queries are compiled down into Druid queries before they're executed.

Druid queries can do various things that TQL queries can't do for security and privacy reasons, and Druid queries are also more verbose. To get into the fine details of Druid's query language, please check the [Apache Druid Documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/).

This example timeseries query returns the number of users per week:

```json
{
  "queryType": "timeseries",
  "dataSource": "telemetry-signals",
  "granularity": "week",
  "aggregations": [
    {
      "fieldName": "clientUser",
      "name": "count",
      "type": "thetaSketch"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example groupBy query groups signals by the `majorSystemVersion` dimension and aggregates them by the `count` metric, resulting in the number of operating system versions:

```json
{
  "queryType": "groupBy",
  "dataSource": "telemetry-signals",
  "granularity": "all",
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "majorSystemVersion",
      "outputName": "Major System Version",
      "outputType": "STRING",
      "type": "default"
    }
  ],
  "aggregations": [
    {
      "fieldName": "count",
      "name": "Number of Signals",
      "type": "longSum"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Properties

The following properties are common to all query types. See pages for each query type for additional properties only for those query types.
